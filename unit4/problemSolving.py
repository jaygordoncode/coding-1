# CALCULATOR APP
# You have been tasked with developing a calculator 
# app that students can use during their standardized test. 
# The calculator should be able to take in a number, followed by an 
# arithmetic operator and then another number. Once your 
# program has all of these components, it should return the answer. 

#  1. What is the problem asking you to do?
'your answers should be in string format...'

# 2. What are some keywords and phrases ? 

# 3. Is there input data that the question provides ?

# 4. What is the desired output ?

# ROCK, PAPER, SCISSOR GAME APP
# You are working on a game concept with several 
# other engineers and you need to provide them with a
#  simple proof of concepts. 
# For now, you have suggested that your 
# game work on a RPS (rock, paper, scissors) loop. 
# When a user plays, rock, paper, or scissors, 
# the computer will randomly select one of the 3 
# options as well. Your program will then determine 
# who won, based on the values. The game should only 
# allow the player to play 3 hands, and inform the 
# player if the won or lost (best 2 out of 3 format.) 

#  1. What is the problem asking you to do?
# We need a basic RPS game wiht a best 2 out of 3 format.
# 2. What are some keywords and phrases ? 
# Random selection from program. 
# User can lay 3 hands/turns
# 3. Is there input data that the question provides ?
# We need to take in the useres RPS selection 
# 4. What is the desired output ?
# Show which player has won or lost
# 5. Pseudocode Steps & Additional Notes 
# // import.random
# //random.range()
# random.choice

# needs to have logic to determine who won after 3 turns as well as asking
#the player if they want to play again
# WE NEED TO HAVE A LOOP

# If/else conditionals to dtermine which option wins/losses; ex. 
#if user slecects rock and cpu slect paper == cpu wins
# Solution

x=1
while x <= 3:
    print('turn')
    x+=1
