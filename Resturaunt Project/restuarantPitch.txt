Mecha mōningu zu is the new and improved futuristic brunch. We have robots serving you and your family with our delicious food! We have very delicious brunch foods and a wide selection of drinks to chose from. We have a cozy and earthy atmosphere. In our restaurant we offer plenty of seating, free wi-fi, and very helpful assistance. We have tons of beatufiul trees and plants to compliment our earthy and calm environment. 
To help our costomers feel as if they are at home we bring bonsai trees, japanese cherry blossom, and japanese maple trees. We are very centered into Japanese culture and we try to bring it into it with our futuristic aspects. The benefits of the plants and environment brings air purification, stress reduction, improved concentraction, patience, self awareness, and self confidence. While the robots are not serving orders or getting orders they are rolling around watering the plants and offering as much help as they can to our costumers to enhance their experince here.
